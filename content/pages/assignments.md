Every student will write two pieces of fiction. These may be short stories or chapters in a longer work. If a student chooses to write long fiction, a short summary of the rest of the book should be appended to the final revised version of the second piece. Your two pieces may be two sections of a single long work, or may be two substantial sections of two different works _in different forms of fantasy_.

Each major piece will be submitted to workshop and rewritten. Every student will be required to finish two pieces of fiction at the end of the class.

Sample Student Work
-------------------

These pieces are intended to demonstrate some of the range of different kinds of work done by students in this course. They also show the kinds of changes that come about through the revisions process. These MIT students have agreed to share their writing as examples of student work.
